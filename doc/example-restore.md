# üì• Example of a restore

**[Back](../README.md)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE WAY HOW THIS TOOL STORES DATA IN S3!**\
You can always restore without this tool. Even via the S3 web console a restore via a browser is possible. (It is just less manual work to use this tool, if there are many files.)\
  * See [S3 UserGuide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/)
  * See [S3 UserGuide - Download Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/download-objects.html)
  * See [S3 UserGuide - Restoring an archived object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/restoring-objects.html)

---
The following example describes the restore, if you want to use this tool also for a restore.

  * In this example you are in the directoy: /Users/rtitz/
  * The following files are in this directory:
```text
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-s3-backup_macos-arm64 <- This is the aws-s3-backup executable, nothing else is required here.
```

  * üìÅ Here is how to list buckets:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKXXXXXXXXX"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

aws-s3-backup_macos-arm64 -mode restore
```

  * Output will be similar to:
```
AWS-S3-BACKUP 1.3.4

MODE: RESTORE
REGION: us-east-1

Available buckets:
  cdk-hnb659fds-assets-123456789012-us-east-1
  my-s3-backup-bucket
  s3-20230312
```

  * üìÑ Here is how to generate restore JSON file:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKXXXXXXXXX" # Only needed if not already done in previous command
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" # Only needed if not already done in previous command

aws-s3-backup_macos-arm64 -mode restore -bucket my-s3-backup-bucket -destination restore/
```

  * Output will be similar to:
```
AWS-S3-BACKUP 1.3.4

MODE: RESTORE
REGION: us-east-1

Generated: 'generated-restore-input.json'

Do you want to continue with restore, without editing generated input JSON? [y/N]: y

## üßä Glacier Restore Examples

### Restore with Glacier Objects (Interactive)
```bash
# Tool will detect Glacier objects and ask for confirmation
aws-s3-backup_macos-arm64 -mode restore -bucket my-glacier-bucket -destination restore/
```

Output will show:
```
üßä Found 3 objects in Glacier storage classes that may need restore
üîÑ 3 objects need to be restored from Glacier
  - backup/file1.tar.gz (GLACIER_FLEXIBLE_RETRIEVAL, 2.3 MB)
  - backup/file2.tar.gz (DEEP_ARCHIVE, 1.8 MB)
  - backup/file3.tar.gz (GLACIER, 950 KB)

Do you want to restore these 3 objects from Glacier storage? [y/N]: y

üîÑ Initiating restore for 3 objects (mode: bulk, expires after: 3 days)
üîÑ Restoring: backup/file1.tar.gz
‚úÖ Restore initiated for: backup/file1.tar.gz
‚è∞ Bulk retrieval typically takes 5-12 hours for Glacier, up to 48 hours for Deep Archive

‚ùå Glacier restore failed: restore requests initiated. Please wait for completion before downloading
```

### Expedited Restore (Fast)
```bash
# Use expedited mode for GLACIER_FLEXIBLE_RETRIEVAL (1-5 minutes)
aws-s3-backup_macos-arm64 -mode restore -bucket my-glacier-bucket -destination restore/ -retrievalMode expedited -restoreWithoutConfirmation
```

### Auto-Retry Restore
```bash
# Automatically retry every 5 minutes until objects are available
aws-s3-backup_macos-arm64 -mode restore -bucket my-glacier-bucket -destination restore/ -autoRetryDownloadMinutes 5 -restoreWithoutConfirmation
```

Output shows progress:
```
üîÑ Auto-retry enabled: checking restore status every 5 minutes
üìä Restore progress: 1/3 objects ready (2 still waiting)
‚è∞ Waiting 5 minutes before next check...
üìä Restore progress: 3/3 objects ready (0 still waiting)
üéâ All Glacier objects are now restored and available for download
```
## üåê Network Interruption During Restore

If network connection is lost during restore:

```
‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading: backup/file005.tar.gz
‚ö†Ô∏è Download backup/file005.tar.gz failed (attempt 1): read tcp: connection reset by peer
üîÑ Retrying in 1s... (Press Ctrl+C to cancel, will retry for up to 12 hours)
‚ö†Ô∏è Download backup/file005.tar.gz failed (attempt 2): dial tcp: no route to host
üîÑ Retrying in 2s... (Press Ctrl+C to cancel, will retry for up to 12 hours)
[Network restored]
‚úÖ Download backup/file005.tar.gz succeeded after 3 attempts
‚úÖ Successfully downloaded: file005.tar.gz
```

**Recovery Process:**
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- No data corruption or partial downloads
- Completed downloads are preserved
- User can cancel and resume later if needed
## üîê Encrypted File Restore

When restoring encrypted files, you'll be prompted for the password:

```
‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading: backup/encrypted-file.tar.gz.enc (5.2 MB)
‚úÖ Successfully downloaded: encrypted-file.tar.gz.enc

üîê Encrypted files detected. Enter decryption password: [password hidden]
üîì Decrypting: encrypted-file.tar.gz.enc -> encrypted-file.tar.gz
‚úÖ Successfully decrypted: encrypted-file.tar.gz
üìé Decompressing: encrypted-file.tar.gz
‚úÖ Successfully decompressed and removed: encrypted-file.tar.gz
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- **Keep your password safe** - without it, encrypted files cannot be recovered
- **Manual decryption available** - `decrypt_manual.py` script provided as backup
- **Test encryption setup** before relying on it for important data

## üïí Timestamp Preservation

All original timestamps are preserved during restore:

```
üìé Decompressing: backup.tar.gz
‚úÖ Successfully decompressed and removed: backup.tar.gz
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Could not set timestamps for /readonly/dir: permission denied
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ File modification and access times preserved
- ‚úÖ Directory timestamps maintained  
- ‚úÖ File permissions restored
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-fatal warnings if timestamps can't be set (read-only filesystems)
